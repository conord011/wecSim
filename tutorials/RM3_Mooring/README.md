**WEC-Sim Version:** v2.2

One example using the [RM3 geometry](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html#two-body-point-absorber-rm3) coupled with [MoorDyn](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/features.html#using-moordyn) to simulate a more realistic mooring system, and another modeling the RM3 with a Mooring Matrix. The MoorDyn application consists of 3 catenary mooring lines attached to floating buoys and then to different points on the spar and anchored at the sea floor.
